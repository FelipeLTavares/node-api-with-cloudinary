# BASE API

## What's this?

> It were supposed to be a Properties registers application ðŸ˜…
> This is an small project to practice my learnings about backend architecture. In my old projects a always put together all files and generic folders inside the same folder. Now a tried to separate them in a better way. I isolate the Databases files insside a folder and the application files in other. Furthermore, I tried to separate the application in: Controllers, Services and Repositories, instead of only Controllers.
> Also, I tried to use a function to deal with Multipart data in http requests.

## Give it a try!

> First, configure the database;
> After this, use the route "http://localhost:5000/imoveis";
> The get route will return all registers; the post will create one single register, and same for put and delete routes;
> Adding v2 to the pathname, you will have to send a multipart data inside your the http request

## Thanks for the visit!
